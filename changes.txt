Changes in version 1.4.2 beta (2011-03-25):
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed diagram print.

Changes in version 1.4.1 beta (2011-03-11):
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed specification of relative output path on Windows.
- Allowing/disabling of usage of tabulators in generated code doesn't require the CodeDesigner
  restart anymore.

Changes in version 1.4.0 beta (2011-03-04):
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed Horizontal/Vertical tree layout algorithm.
- CodeDesigner can be run with "-g" parameter followed by path to existing CodeLite project which
  will cause immediate loading and generation of the project in "silent mode" (CodeDesigner will
  exit after the code generation without showing its window).
- Added ability to change diagram scale by using mouse wheel.
- Implemented CodeLite integration plugin.

Changes in version 1.3.0 beta (2011-01-02):
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed typo in default variable code item's description.
- Fixed code generation of event transition leading from composite state which includes simple
  states.
- Slightly tweaked diagram grid.
- Added diagram autolayout features.

Changes in version 1.2.0 beta (2010-09-02):
------------------------------------------------
- Data type of function parameters is now displayed in diagrams.
- Added support for Enumeration and Include Association to Python code generator.
- Added partial support for Basic Aggregation and Composition Aggregation to Class Diagram
  code generator (for both C++ and Python languages).
- Added ability to enable/disable code generation for specific classes (useful for 'built-in'
  base classes which shouldn't be generated).
- Fixed code generation to per-diagram-specified output file names.
- Fixed modification of class constructor's code via properties dialog.
- Added ability to create diagram element links in diagrams. For example, thanks to this feature
  classes located in one diagram can be used as a bases in a second one, etc. The links
  can be created via dragging from Project items tree if CTRL+ALT is pressed down.
- Fixed improper order of generated base class constructor's parameters.
- Fixed generation of value type sign with user-defined data types.
- Added ability to generate code comments if requested (per-project settings).

Changes in version 1.1.4 beta (2010-07-29):
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed crash occuring when any code item was modified (or properties dialog was closed)
  without previously opened diagram.
- Fixed in-place handling of class members.
- Default values of class data members are displayed in class elements.
- Added support for Enumeration elements in UML class diagram.
- Added support for Include association in UML class diagram.
- Subdiagram can be dropped onto state chart transitions and composite states which will
  create appropriate diagram wrapper calling it.
- Fixed generation of state chart actions with parameters.

Changes in version 1.1.3 beta (2010-06-24):
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed refresh of diagram components which weren't refreshed correctly in some cases.
- Fixed crash that could occure during drag&drop operations in Project items tree.
- Diagram elements can be copied also by dragging from Project items tree (CTRL key must be pressed
  down during the dragging).
- Classes can be instantiated in state chart transitions and composite states (just by dropping
  of a class element onto relevant transition/composite state).
- If diagram element name has changed then also code items' contents refering to the changed name
  are updated in accordance to the new element's name.
- Class members/associations access type can be set via context menu.

Changes in version 1.1.2 beta (2010-06-03):
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed redundantly included header file in generated definition module.
- Added support for class templates including class templates specialization.

Changes in version 1.1.1 beta (2010-05-14):
------------------------------------------------
- Removed annoying messages occured if application settings or diagram bank
  couldn't be read.
- Fixed build problems on amd64 platform (patch by foldink).
- Redesigned application's file structure.
- Application's executable file names changed to lowercase form (e.g. 'codedesigner'
  instead of 'CodeDesigner').
- Fixed false warning ('Initialization has failed') occured during code generation.
- Added splash screen (on option).

Changes in version 1.1.0 beta (2010-05-09):
------------------------------------------------
- Initial release
