What is CodeDesigner?
-------------------------

CodeDesigner is free and open-source RAD tool suitable for easy creation of various diagrams
describing applications' structure and logic (class diagrams, state charts, ...) and for generation
of production-ready source code from them. The application is available for MS Windows, Linux and
OS X and can be used as a free alternative to Enterprise Architect or IAR Visual State commercial
tools.

In contrast to other similar CASE tools the CodeDesigner is aimed to generation of production-ready
source code from supported diagrams. It means that not only application skeleton can be generated from
diagrams but complete full-featured application including its entry point (main function) can be produced
by a one click.

Supported diagrams:
- UML class diagrams
- Simple state chart
- Hierarchical (UML, Harel) state charts

Supported programming languages:
- ANSI C
- C++
- Python

Supported code generators:
- Class code generator (C++, Python)
- Simple state chart generator
	- GOTO algorithm (C, C++)
	- Loop Case algorithm (C, C++)
	- Else-If algorithm (C, C++, Python)

- Hierarchical state chart generator
	- GOTO algorithm (C, C++)
	- Loop Case algorithm (C, C++)
	- Else-If algorithm (C, C++, Python)
