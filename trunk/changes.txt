Changes in version 1.2.1 beta (2010-10-12):
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed typo in default variable code item's description.
- Fixed code generation of event transition leading from composite state which includes simple
  states.
- Slightly tweaked diagram grid.

Changes in version 1.2.0 beta (2010-09-02):
------------------------------------------------
- Data type of function parameters is now displayed in diagrams.
- Added support for Enumeration and Include Association to Python code generator.
- Added partial support for Basic Aggregation and Composition Aggregation to Class Diagram
  code generator (for both C++ and Python languages).
- Added ability to enable/disable code generation for specific classes (useful for 'built-in'
  base classes which shouldn't be generated).
- Fixed code generation to per-diagram-specified output file names.
- Fixed modification of class constructor's code via properties dialog.
- Added ability to create diagram element links in diagrams. For example, thanks to this feature
  classes located in one diagram can be used as a bases in a second one, etc. The links
  can be created via dragging from Project items tree if CTRL+ALT is pressed down.
- Fixed improper order of generated base class constructor's parameters.
- Fixed generation of value type sign with user-defined data types.
- Added ability to generate code comments if requested (per-project settings).

Changes in version 1.1.4 beta (2010-07-29):
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed crash occuring when any code item was modified (or properties dialog was closed)
  without previously opened diagram.
- Fixed in-place handling of class members.
- Default values of class data members are displayed in class elements.
- Added support for Enumeration elements in UML class diagram.
- Added support for Include association in UML class diagram.
- Subdiagram can be dropped onto state chart transitions and composite states which will
  create appropriate diagram wrapper calling it.
- Fixed generation of state chart actions with parameters.

Changes in version 1.1.3 beta (2010-06-24):
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed refresh of diagram components which weren't refreshed correctly in some cases.
- Fixed crash that could occure during drag&drop operations in Project items tree.
- Diagram elements can be copied also by dragging from Project items tree (CTRL key must be pressed
  down during the dragging).
- Classes can be instantiated in state chart transitions and composite states (just by dropping
  of a class element onto relevant transition/composite state).
- If diagram element name has changed then also code items' contents refering to the changed name
  are updated in accordance to the new element's name.
- Class members/associations access type can be set via context menu.

Changes in version 1.1.2 beta (2010-06-03):
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed redundantly included header file in generated definition module.
- Added support for class templates including class templates specialization.

Changes in version 1.1.1 beta (2010-05-14):
------------------------------------------------
- Removed annoying messages occured if application settings or diagram bank
  couldn't be read.
- Fixed build problems on amd64 platform (patch by foldink).
- Redesigned application's file structure.
- Application's executable file names changed to lowercase form (e.g. 'codedesigner'
  instead of 'CodeDesigner').
- Fixed false warning ('Initialization has failed') occured during code generation.
- Added splash screen (on option).

Changes in version 1.1.0 beta (2010-05-09):
